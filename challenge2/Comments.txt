README.md could be a bit improvable. You should highlight better how to getting started with your library.
Really love the #include "testCases.hpp". Carefull that not all people like this kind of approach.

General Comments:
  - I don't like the fact that the vector sizes in the test have been hardcoded.  They should be dependent on the size of the matrix.
  - Non const operator not defined. If the matrix is const, the operator should be const as well.
